#### Topic of the Conference
We understand that Christine de Pizan has chief importance for the intellectual history of the Middle Ages and especially for the expansion of the philosophical canon in order to include women authors. Especially, we acknowledge that the attention of historians of philosophy to Pizan’s work is still limited.

The conference will consider abstracts covering all aspects of Christine de Pizan philosophical thought and its legacy. Submissions will be accepted in English, French, and Portuguese. Since the conference is international, we strongly suggest all talks to be given in English.
