<p>The Medieval Academy of America, on behalf of its Committee on Centres and Regional Associations, invites applications for its summer programmes and tuition scholarships. These enable students to participate in summer courses in medieval languages or manuscript studies.</p>

#### CARA summer programs and tuition scholarships

<p>Applications must be received by 1 April and will be judged by the CARA Committee. There will be between four and eight awards yearly, depending upon the number of worthy applicants and the cost of the summer programs. Due to limited resources, CARA Summer Scholarship awards normally will not exceed US$1000.</p>
